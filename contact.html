            introduction of my life over the first year of my college. These are
            the things I do, and I believe most students of my age don't. I'd
            like to say it's the definition of "self-disciplined."

            I hit the gym usually five days a week. It's a great way to relax.

            I also often go jogging at the Quanfu sport field during training
            breaks. It's one of my ways to relax, seeing people join together.
            Some are playing football, while most of them are taking good care
            of their bodies.

            Every now and then, my cram school teacher gives me some articles
            from The New York Times. I learn a lot about what's happening in the
            world. Every part of this globe has its own story going on.
            Sometimes it's about environmental issues, politics, aging
            population, or writer strikes (recently in the USA). For me, it's
            not just about learning English, but a way to have a look at the
            world and think about what each issue exactly means to us.

            I love listening to podcasts. One of my favorite podcasters is Conan
            O'Brien, the former late-night show host of TBS. He is the funniest,
            most talented, and fantastic person I've ever seen in my life. It is
            him who has taught me a lot of English, and more importantly, some
            life lessons that no one else could ever teach through his eventful,
            roller-coaster life journey. I love learning English because of him.
            His charisma on the show is also quite well-known.

            Firstly, I want to introduce ISA (International Student
            Association), a club where I have met so many interesting foreigners
            from all around the world. It's fortunate for me to get to talk to
            them and know more about their stories. Sometimes we hang out
            together and enjoy the distinct foreign cultures. It also strikes me
            that the fear of talking to foreigners that Taiwanese people have
            held for so many years has been an ingrained terror. What a pity! We
            could have had a glimpse of the terrific beauty of people from
            different countries. I know it's about education and cultural
            differences, but I believe there must be solutions to solve it, and
            technology is one of them.

              This was once the #1 New York Times bestseller written by the CEO
              of the Walt Disney Company. I read this book during winter
              vacation last semester. What an amazing book that contains
              once-in-a-lifetime stories and lessons taken from all kinds of
              events and from people that the author, Robert Iger, had dealt
              with! I've always believed that stories are the best teachers in
              terms of life lessons, and this book proves it. What I observed is
              that he had great habits since his youth: getting up early,
              talking with his dad about international issues, working out
              regularly, and so on.

              Because of my lack of vocabulary, it has been troublesome reading
              about his life while constantly checking the meanings of words.
              So, I decided to read it again to review his eventful life and
              philosophy.

            This book is highly recommended on the internet. It's a story about
            money and touches upon how there's a clear difference between the
            rich and the wealthy. I'm looking forward to learning things from
            this book.

              The only thing I remember the most was when he told me,
              "Creativity is your gift that no one else has in this room. You
              are the only one who has impressed me. Cherish it. You are pretty
              much like me. We share this superpower. And if you want to create
              something, just do it!"

              That's one of the main reasons I'm confident that I can make a
